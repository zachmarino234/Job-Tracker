## About

As college students who are actively seeking internships, we find it extremely difficult to keep up with the fast-paced and convoluted recruiting process. Applications for companies release at different times, on different websites, with different interview schedules. This sheer amount of information often makes a spreadsheet overwhelming and inefficient when it comes to strategizing our interview process. As well, we have no frame of reference when it comes to what types of jobs are popular, what companies are seeing an uptick of applications, etc. With that in mind, we created TalentTrace, a Job Tracker and database where users can not only track their job applications, but the entries they add are aggregated into trends that everyone can see and use.
